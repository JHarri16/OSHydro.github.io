Cruise Tools is a plugin for QGIS 3.x aimed to help the ocean mapper to  perform the following reoccurring tasks just in few clicks:

 - Loading, coloring and shading bathymetry grids

 - Exporting colored and shaded RGB grids

 - Calculating raster coverage

 - Creating smooth filtered contours

 - Generating DD, DDM, and XY coordinate attributes for point features

 - Generating length (m, km, and nm) attributes for line features

 - Generating area (m2 and km2) attributes for polygon feature

 - Estimating MBES coverage on a specific DEM

 - Exporting the survey lines plan to the navigation system

  

It is developed by Simon Dreutter and  Fynn Warnke  (Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research.)
