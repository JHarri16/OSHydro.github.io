Pydro Explorer organizes a wide range of Python Based tools for hydrography developed by 
OCS Hydrographic Systems and Technologies Branch (HSTB). 

Pydro Explorer also provides a downloadable version. The version control system is currently 
only available internally, but the full python source code is provided in the downloadable 
distribution. 

HSTB aims to move the modules to GitHub in 2020.
