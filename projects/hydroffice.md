![logo](../resources/hydroffice.png){: .center-image }

HydrOffice represents an open-source collaborative effort led by the Center for Coastal and 
Ocean Mapping to develop a research software environment with applications to facilitate 
all phases of the ping-to-chart process: facilitate data acquisition, automate and enhance 
data processing, and improve hydrographic products.

Most HydrOffice tools are also available in the NOAA [Pydro](pydro.md) distribution.
